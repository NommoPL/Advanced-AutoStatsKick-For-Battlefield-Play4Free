As the name says - it's auto-kicker for several stats, which you define.

Possibilities for today:

Kicks for statspadding:
- Best Score
- Kill Streak

Kicks for weapon stats:
- You can define maximum accuracy and head shot ratio values for EVERY weapon separately.

How to install ? Just check youtube video :)
